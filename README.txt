Journify is a web app that produces personalized meditation scripts upon analyses 
of journal entries over time. Using API of a large scale language model and OpenAI, 
user journal entries are parsed and emotions are detected before generating a 
personalized meditation script.

For the sake of conciseness, I have opted not to include many of the image and 
Flask/React setup files to this repo.
